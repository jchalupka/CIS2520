Compilation
***********

In order to compile the program when inside the ChalupkaJordanA1 folder use the command: 

make

You will now have three executable files named solveMaze, testMaze, and testStack.

*****
Usage
*****

solveMaze: 
    This program is used to solve any maze that is less than 100x100 characters.
    To use this program enter:
        ./bin/solveMaze ./doc/mazes/[MAZE NAME]
    ./doc/mazes/[MAZE NAME] can be replaced with the location of any maze.
    There are five mazes already located inside of the doc/mazes/ directory:
	maze0, maze1, maze2, maze3, and maze4.
    * Note that maze1 may look distorted if your window is not large enough
    as this is a 100x100 maze.  Make your text smaller to avoid any distortion
    when using this maze.

testMaze:
    This program is used to test the maze solver.
    It will run through all five of the mazes inside of the doc/mazes/ directory
    and solve each maze.
    To use this program enter:
        ./bin/testMaze 
 
testStack:
    This program is used to test the Stack ADT.
    It will run through all of tests to ensure that the Stack is working properly.
    To use this program enter:
        ./bin/testStack 

*******
Testing
*******

Testing was conducted using the test functions testMaze.c and testStack.c.
To use these functions see the Usage section of the README.
For more information on testing, read the testing document for at:
    doc/

*****************
Known Limitations
*****************

For mazes larger than 100x100 the size of the arrays holding the maze maps are not guaranteed to work with these large mazes.
