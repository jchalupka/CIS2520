Below are the different tests used to test the two sorting algorithms:

1. Sorting Binary Numbers (1 and 0)
Bubble Sort:		274.5 ms
Recursive Bubble Sort:	122.9 ms

2. Sorting Medium Sized Numbers (0 - 100)
Bubble Sort:		339.3 ms
Recursive Bubble Sort:	133.1 ms

3. Sorting Large Sized Numbers (0 - 10,000)
Bubble Sort:		345.6 ms
Recursive Bubble Sort:	124.3 ms

4. Sorting a Wide Range of Numbers (-100,000 - 100,000)
Bubble Sort:		343.6 ms
Recursive Bubble Sort:	128.4 ms

5. Sorting a very large array (100,000 integers)
Bubble Sort:		38215.3 ms
Recursive Bubble Sort:	13345.2 ms

*Tests 1-4 were conducted using arrays of size 10,000.

Conclusion
**********

The tests concluded that the Recursive Bubble Sort is more efficient.
In every test conducted the recursive bubble sort was roughly twice as
fast as the bubble sort.

Another note is that as the size of the integers increased, there was
no sizeable increase in the time it took to sort the integer array.
Likewise a large range in integers showed small effect in speed increase
when compared to a medium range.

It wa noticed that when the range of numbers decreased dramatically,
sorting the integer arrays became faster.  This finding can be attributed to 
less range meaning less switch operations need to be performed, as there
is a greater change the two numbers beside each other are the same 
(for example the binary sort).
