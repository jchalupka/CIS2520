In order to compile the program when inside the Lab2ChalupkaJordan file use the command: 

make

You will now have an executable file named test.

Usage
*****

To run the a program which will test the linked list ADT,
 while inside the same directory as before which will 
now contain an executable file named test,
use this command:

make run

*******
Testing
*******

Testing was conducted using the test file test.c.
Included in this file is tests for each individual function, as well
as tests that use a combination of all of the functions.

The test program is thorough as it tests each individual function
in the ADT.  This ensures that each function is working properly.
Also, each function was tested with NULL list ADTs, to test
for uninitialized ADT errors.

Also, valgrind was used to discover any memory leaks.  After testing with valgrind,
the program currently has the status, “no memory leaks possible”.

*****************
Known Limitations
*****************

List was not made generic, and will need to be updated in the future.
