About
*****

This file contains three programs which make use of a binary tree library to store restaurant data.  The three programs contained in this file are responsible for: 
  i) Displaying the information in the tree sorted by either name or rating
     as a list.
 ii) Displaying the information in the tree sorted by either name or rating
     in a tree.
iii) Testing the program’s main functions.

***********
Compilation
***********

In order to compile the program when inside the Lab8ChalupkaJordan folder use the command: 

make

You will now have three executable files named test_f, test_c, and test_o in bin/.

*****
Usage
*****

test_f:	This program is designed to test the programs core functions. To run this
 	program simply type, “./bin/test_f”

test_t:	This program is designed to demonstrate the tree printing ability of the 
	restaurant data.  To run this program simply type, “./bin/test_t”.
	
	Once running the program, press enter to cycle through several demonstration files,
	demonstrating the tree printing ability.

test_o: This program is designed to demonstrate the sorting mechanism of the restaurant data.
	To  run this program simply type, “./bin/test_o <Name of test file>”.

	Test files can be found in .testFiles/
