Testing was separated between the three programs in this file.

******************
Functions (test_f)
******************
The following core functions are tested:
	openFile
	collectFile
	createRestaurant
	destroyRestaurant
	compareName
By running the bin/test_f executable, unit tests can be performed on all of these functions.

**********************
Tree Printing (test_t)
**********************
The tree printing function has been tested using three different data files, each containing names, and foodtypes of different lengths.

The tree printing program has also been tested to print the tree in order by name, and rating.  Also, the tree printing program has different functions to implement in-order, and post-order printing of the tree.

***********************
Order Printing (test_o)
***********************
The order printing program has been tested using three different data files.
Sorting can be done using the name and the rating.
In-order, and post-order printing are also available for this program (only the in-order prints in order).
