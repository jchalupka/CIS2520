Testing
*********

Testing for this assignment was focused on the Binary Tree ADT, and on the libraries used to gain information on the file system (directories and files).

Testing the user-interface for this program was done using the directories found in tests/testDirectories.

*******************
  Binary Tree ADT
(BinaryTree_test.c)
*******************

This file contains tests for each of the functions in the Binary Tree ADT.
Functionality such as sorting ability, obtaining heights, insertion, removal, searching, were tested, among others.  

Each function returns whether the function was correct in itâ€™s testing.
At the end of all tests, the number of incorrect tests is returned.

These unit tests were very useful in ensuring the continued accuracy of my Binary Tree library.


*******************
  Library Testing
     (test.c)
*******************

This file contains testing that was done on various libraries (mainly dirent.h).
These tests were not meant to be correct, but rather to explore the abilities of the libraries, and discover where the libraries fail.

By doing this testing it became much easier to implement these libraries in my program.

A major tool used in debugging the libraries was this macro:

#define REPORT_ERROR()											\
do { 															\
	fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: %s\n"								\
	"LINE: %d\n"												\
	"FILE: %s\n"												\
	"%s %s\n\n", 												\
	strerror(errno), __LINE__, __FILE__, __TIME__, __DATE__);	\
} while (0); 

This macro made it very easy to see which file, and which line errors were coming from, and also gave an error message corresponding to the error the library gave.
