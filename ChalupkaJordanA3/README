About
*****

This program acts as a file manager for all of the files and folders in the directory given as an argv parameter and all of its subdirectories.  This program provides functionality to delete files, to move files.  The user can also print out a list, and a diagram displaying the directories stored by the program.

The ADT used in this program is an AVL tree.  Balancing is done after each operation to ensure that the AVL tree is balanced throughout the program.

Libraries used in this program include ncurses, and dirent.

***********
Compilation
***********

In order to compile the program when inside the ChalupkaJordanA3 folder use the command: 

make

You will now have an executable named fileManager.

*****
Usage
*****

run:
	This program is used to run the phone book program.
	To use this program enter:
	./bin/fileManager <path to directory>

	Once using the program follow the directions in the application.

	Alternatively, the program can be run with just ./bin/fileManager, 
	and the user will be prompted to enter the path.

*******
Testing
*******

Testing was conducted to ensure the functionality of all of the menu options, and library functions.
For information on testing, see docs/testing.

*****************
Known Limitations
*****************

Speed of the AVL tree could be improved by storing the balance factor in the BinNode struct.
However, my implementation acts as a wrapper to a Binary Tree, so this improvement was left out.
