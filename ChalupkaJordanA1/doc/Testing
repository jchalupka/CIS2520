Testing
***********************************

This testing document is broken down into two sections:
Testing the Maze Solver Program, and testing the Stack ADT

***********************************
Maze Solver
***********************************

Testing on the maze solver program was conducted using the mazeTest program.  
This program tests a series of mazes to guarantee correct performance.
The mazes used by the test program offer a wide variety of situation for the 
mazes such as:
    wide hallways
    non-edge starting/ending positions
    100x100 sized maze
Possible situations not featured in the test mazes in this program (to avoid confusion for program failure) are:
    no solution puzzles
    no start and or end puzzles (The S and F were removed)
    invalid puzzle file names 
All of these situations listed above are working and have been tested.

***********************************
Stack ADT
***********************************

Testing was conducted using the test file testStack.c.
Included in this file is tests for each individual function, as well
as tests that use a combination of all of the functions.

The test program is thorough as it tests each individual function
in the ADT.  This ensures that each function is working properly.
Also, each function was tested with NULL stack ADTs, to test
for uninitialized ADT errors.

Also, valgrind was used to discover any memory leaks.  After testing with valgrind,
the program currently has the status, “no memory leaks possible”.
