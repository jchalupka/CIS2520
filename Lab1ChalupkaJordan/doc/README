Compilation
***********

In order to compile the program when inside the Lab1ChalupkaJordan file use the command: 

make

You will now have an executable file named test.

*****
Usage
*****

To run the a program which will test the fraction ADT,
 while inside the same directory as before which will 
now contain an executable file named test,
use this command:

make run

*******
Testing
*******

Testing was conducted using the test file test.c.
Included in this file is tests for each individual function, as well
as tests that use a combination of all of the functions.

The test program is thorough as it tests each individual function
in the ADT.  This ensures that each function is working properly.

Also this test program runs randomized tests which rely on the 
correctness of all of the functions working together.
The randomized tests are currently set to run 10 tests,
but this value can and has been changed to test up to 100,000
test cases with zero errors.  The values in the randomized tests
can and has also been changed to include very large values as well
as small values, as well as positives and negative values, to ensure
correctness.

Zero has previously been included in the test program, but has been removed
due to obvious errors it causes when placed in the denominator.
See question 2 for implementation of a program that solves zero-denominators.
Zero does function properly when placed as a numerator in previous tests.


*****************
Known Limitations
*****************

Error when zero is placed as a denominator.  This was not included in the source
code as it was only necessary in the instructions to include implementation
instructions in question 2.
